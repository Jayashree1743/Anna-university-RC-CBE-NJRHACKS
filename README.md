## Problem Statement
**Theme:** Quantum Computing  
 **Problem Statement:** *Quantum Detective:Cracking Financial Anomalies*  
  Traditional Machine Learning Models often face challenges like fraudlent activities,unusual anomolies due to their size and complexity resulting in less accurate result and slower processing .To overcome  these challenges we use quantum properties to analyse  large dataset more efficiently.  
  Goal : To design the quantum model that demonstrates improvement in Speed ,Scalability and Accuracy when compared to Classical methods .
